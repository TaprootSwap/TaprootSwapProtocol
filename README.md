Just like BRC-20, TRSPâ€”-Taproot Swap Protocol, is just a fun experimental standard that demonstrates a way to make exchange easier for the token created by Ordinal Inscriptions.It should not be considered THE ONLY standard for a BRC-20ï¼ˆor ORC-20 or something elseï¼‰ AMM Exchange , as we believe there are almost certainly better design choices and optimization improvements to be made. Consequently, this is a very dynamic experiment, and I strongly discourage any financial decisions based on its design. I do, however, encourage the bitcoin community to tinker with standard designs and optimizations until a general consensus on best practices is reached (or to decide that this is a bad idea altogether!).

Designed with simplicity in mind, TRSP provides an interface for seamless exchange of BRC-20 tokens. Token listing is open and free. The whole project will be open-sourced and all upgrades are opt-in. This site will serve as a project overview for TRSP - explaining how it works, how to use it, and how to build on top of it. These docs are actively being updated and more information will be added on an ongoing basis.

TRSP (Taproot Swap Protocol) is a decentralized protocol for exchanging BRC-20 (or ORC-20 or something else) tokens, allowing users to swap against with Liquidity Pools (P2Pool), which are more convenient and easy to use than the existing order book trading method. TRSP adopts the automated market maker (AMM) model, and users can provide liquidity and earn transaction fees as income.
